# Step 2: Create a WordPress Account

In this step, you will be setting up your WordPress.com account. WordPress.com is the main tool we’ll be using to manage your website and costs $25 / month. You will need access to your email address as well as payment details ready to complete this step. 

### **Create an account** 

1. Visit [https://wordpress.com/start/](https://wordpress.com/start/)
2. Fill out an email, username, and password. 
3. You will receive an email asking you to confirm your new account - make sure to complete those instructions when it arrives.

Use the most secure email you have available - preferably a work email address versus a personal account. Since the email you enter here has complete access to editing the website, you want to make sure it’s a secure work-related account. 

### **Set a domain name** 

A domain name that serves as an address, which is used to access your website. We will select the free WordPress domain for now, and map to your desired domain later on in the process \(before launching\). 

Type any text into the search bar \(ex. vaccine\), and you see a panel of results with suggestions. One of the first options would be the free one: \[custom\_part\].wordpress.com. Click the “Select” button.
