# Step 1: Contact us for template access

If you havenâ€™t already done so, please email us at [vaccinations@usdigitalresponse.org](mailto:vaccinations@usdigitalresponse.org) so that we can add you as a user to the site. This step is required to successfully implement your site.

When we add you, you will receive an invitation to set up a WordPress account with the template website. Please do so before proceeding to Step 2.

Let's get started.
