# Step 4: Preview your website

Congratulations! You’ve set up your WordPress website and imported all of our content. Let’s take a moment to look at the progress we’ve made so far. 

1. Go up to the top left and click the WP Admin settings page. You will  see a button in the top left corner labeled “My Site” or “My Sites.” 
2. Tap this button “My Site”, and click on the “View Site” button to preview your site. There will also be a banner at the top reminding you that your website is not launched yet - you can dismiss that.
