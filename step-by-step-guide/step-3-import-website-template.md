# Step 3: Import website template

In this section, you will import the vaccine website template we’ve built for you - including a homepage, webpages, and pre-written content. To complete this step, you will need the installation file mentioned in Step 1 - Create a WordPress Account.

If you encounter any issues along the way, please contact us at [vaccination@usdigitalresponse.org](mailto:vaccination@usdigitalresponse.org). Our team is available to address any customization or deployment needs you may have.

### **Introduction to WordPress.com**

Most of the work you will do in this step will take place in either of two locations:

1. **WordPress.com dashboard:** This is the first screen you see after creating your account. It is the starting point for many of the steps we will perform. If you ever need to return to the WordPress.com dashboard, you can simply enter [www.WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) in your browser. 
2. **WP Admin settings page:** The WP Admin settings page contains additional options we will access in this step. You can find a link to the WP Admin settings page in the left-hand menu of the main WordPress.com dashboard. Scroll down to the very bottom and look for the link titled “WP Admin.” 

### **Install WordPress plugins**

{% hint style="info" %}
To complete this step, make sure you’ve received and completed the account confirmation email that was sent to you by WordPress.com. 
{% endhint %}

1. From the Wordpress.com dashboard, click on “Tools” &gt; “Plugins” on the left-hand menu.
2. You will now add important plugins, related to website migration and improved security. 
3. Add the first plugin: 
4. 1. Click on the search icon, and search for “All-in-One WP Migration” in the search bar. 
   2. Find the box labeled “All-in-One WP Migration,” authored by “ServMax.” 
5. 1. Tap the button labeled “Install”
   2. The plugin will activate automatically after the install is complete. If not, tap the “Activate” button. 
6. Now navigate to the WP Admin settings page, where you will finish the remainder of the setup. You can navigate to WP Admin from the Wordpress.com dashboard by clicking on the last option, “WP Admin” in the left-hand menu. 
7. From the WP Admin Settings Page, click on “Plugins” &gt; “Add New”.
8. Install the following plugin by searching for it in the search box, clicking “Install Now”, then “Activate”. 
9. [Restricted Site Access](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restricted-site-access/) \(author: Jake Goldman\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Double-check that a plugin isn’t already loaded onto your website; if so, click on “Activate.” If the plugin is already active, you don’t need to do anything.
{% endhint %}

### **Making the site private before launch \(For non-Wordpress.com users only\)** 

1. If you are not hosting the website on Wordpress.com, you can make the site private using the “Restricted Site Access” plugin that we installed in the previous step.
2. From the WP Admin settings page, click on “Settings” &gt; “Reading” from the left-hand menu.
3. You will see three options for the “Site Visibility” Section. Select “Restrict site access to visitors who are logged in or allowed by IP address”, and click “Save Changes”. 
4. Launching: once you are done editing the site and wish to launch, simply switch back to the “Allow search engines to index this site” option and click “Save Changes”. 

### **Install the Vaccine Template**

{% hint style="info" %}
In this step, you will need to use the **“vaccinestemplate.wpress”** file in the folder sent to you. Can’t find this file? Email us at [vaccinations@usdigitalresponse.org](mailto:vaccinations@usdigitalresponse.org) and we’ll help you out.
{% endhint %}

1. Follow the instructions in the 1:53-3:31 in the below video \(import section\), using the “vaccinestemplate.wpress” file.
2. The login credentials you created after receiving our invitation should allow you to log back in.
