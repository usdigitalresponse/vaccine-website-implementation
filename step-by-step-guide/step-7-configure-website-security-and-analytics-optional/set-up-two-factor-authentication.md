# Set up two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication is a great way to enhance security for your website. In addition to your usual username and password, two-factor authentication requires an additional piece of information whenever you are logging in to WordPress.com on a new browser. This helps ensure that someone can’t discover your password and login without your approval. 

Follow these steps to set up two-factor authentication on WordPress.com: 

1. Go to the main WordPress.com dashboard. 
2. In the upper-right corner of the screen, tap the “Profile” button. It looks like a silhouette of a person. 
3. In the left-hand menu of the new screen, tap “Security.” 
4. In the top menu on the next screen, tap “Two-Step Authentication.” Then, tap “Get Started.” 
5. The most secure option available is “Verify via App.” \(Note: You may need to begin typing a phone number to enable the “Verify” buttons\). 
6. On the next screen, follow the instructions to download an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator or OTP Auth. You will need to be on a smartphone and have the ability to download apps in order to use this authentication method. 
7. In the final step, you will receive Backup Codes for authentication. Make sure to save these in a file - or print them out - where you will be able to find them again. These are important for recovering your account if you ever forget your login information.
