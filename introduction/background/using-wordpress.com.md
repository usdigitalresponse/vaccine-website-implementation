# Using WordPress.com

Our template is built on the WordPress platform and we recommend using a WordPress.com account to host and manage your website. 

Please note that WordPress.com does charge a fee of $25 / month for this service. It is the only cost associated with setting up your website. We are unaffiliated with WordPress.com and don’t profit from this - the website template we’ve built for you is free of charge, as is any support or technical assistance we provide to help you with your installation! 

If you already have a WordPress.com account for personal use, you can start a new account that any approved staff member can use. This account will host your new site.

If you are managing a web host that supports WordPress and will not be using WordPress.com to install your new website, you can skip ahead to the instructions in Step 2. Our template will still work just fine for you.
