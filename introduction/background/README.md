In just a few hours, you will be able to set up a modern, user-friendly site that works on desktops and mobile phones. The website comes pre-built with a navigational homepage and customizable content, including pages to help people understand when theyâ€™ll be eligible for the vaccine, what current safety and efficacy data is available on the vaccines, where to find vaccines nearby, and a visualization of how many doses have already been administered by entering simple usage data.

We hope this user guide helps you customize your new website. Let us know if we missed something. Are the instructions unclear? Please contact us with questions and suggestions to improve the guide. Email us at [vaccinations@usdigitalresponse.org](mailto:vaccinations@usdigitalresponse.org).
