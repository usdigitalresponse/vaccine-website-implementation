# Best practices

Building a landing page can be deceptively easy. Using a website builder \(like WordPress\) means you donâ€™t have to be a developer to publish something professional, and you can do it in a matter of hours.

That said, going in blind is not recommended. To give you a better head start, here are some best practices that have been proven time and time again to improve readership and engagement rates.

### Theme Requirements

Do not add components to the homepage because this is a theme requirement.

### **Writing style**

* When rewriting or customizing content in the site template, use plain, straightforward language, and keep a simple sentence structure. 
* Write in a simple, active voice, and avoid using passive voice when possible. 
* Avoid using buzzwords, jargon, or other complex wording because they may be unfamiliar or confusing to your voters.

### **Capitalization** 

* For headlines, page subheaders, and button text, use title case styling.
* For paragraph copy and other text, use sentence case styling.
