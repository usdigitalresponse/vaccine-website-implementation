# Navigating the WordPress dashboard

Learn how to navigate WordPress using the admin dashboard, create and edit pages, and unpublish pages.

### **Main WordPress dashboard** 

* The main WordPress Dashboard is found by visiting the URL [www.WordPress.com](../background/using-wordpress.com.md). 
* This will be the starting point for many of the steps in this guide. 

### **WP Admin Dashboard** 

The WP Admin Dashboard is found by 

1. visiting the main WordPress dashboard
2. scrolling over to the left-hand menu, scrolling to the bottom, and
3. tapping the row that says “WP Admin.” This will be the location of many customization features. 

### **Begin editing a page** 

* Open the WordPress.com main dashboard. 
* In the “Site” section, tap “Pages.” 
* In the list of pages, search or scroll to the row you want to edit. 
* On the far right of the row, tap the button with three dots. 
* Select “Edit” in the menu. 

### **Unpublish a page** 

* Begin editing the page you want to unpublish. 
* Make sure the “Page” menu is visible on the right side of the page. 
* If you do not see a “Page” menu, look to the upper right corner of the page and tap the button with a gear on it. Hovering over this button should show the label “Settings.” 
* In the Page menu, look for the row labeled “Visibility.” 
* Tap the current visibility setting, and change it to “Private.” 
* Confirm the popup. This page is now only visible to you. Make sure there are no links around your website leading visitors to the page!
